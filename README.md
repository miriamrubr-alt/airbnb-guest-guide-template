## What is an Airbnb guest guide?

An Airbnb guest guide (also called a **welcome book** or **house manual**) is a document sent to guests after booking and before arrival.

It explains:
- how to enter the property  
- WiFi access  
- parking instructions  
- house rules  
- appliance usage  
- checkout procedure  
- local recommendations  

Most guest problems happen because guests arrive confused.  
A clear pre-arrival guide prevents 70%+ of daily host messages.

## Why hosts need one

Typical guest messages every host receives:

- “What is the WiFi password?”  
- “How do I open the building door?”  
- “Where can I park?”  
- “Can I check in late?”  
- “How does the heating work?”  

Instead of answering the same questions every day, professional hosts send a structured guide automatically before arrival.

## Sample Guide

See:  
`/sample-guides/airbnb-apartment.md`

You can copy and edit it for apartments, vacation homes, or multi-unit properties.

## Digital vs PDF welcome book

Many hosts still send a PDF manually.  
This works at the beginning but becomes difficult when managing multiple bookings.

A digital guest guide that is automatically sent before check-in prevents:
- missed messages  
- late-night guest calls  
- wrong check-in codes  
- poor reviews due to confusion

## Automating the guest guide

Some hosts use automation software to send the guide automatically and centralize guest communication.

## Direct booking owners

If you accept direct bookings, a guide is even more important because guests do not receive platform instructions.
